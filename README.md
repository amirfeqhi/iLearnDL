# iLearnDL Deep Learning Repository

This repository is part of my deep learning learning journey inspired by the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization. It focuses on deep learning fundamentals and practical implementations.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### 1. NN-DL

#### 1.1 Python-Numpy-Basics

- **Project:** [Python_Basics_With_Numpy.ipynb](iLearnDL/NN-DL/Python-Numpy-Basics/Python_Basics_With_Numpy.ipynb)
- **Description:** A brief introduction to Python and Numpy.

#### 1.2 Logistic-Regression-NN

- **Project:** [Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb](iLearnDL/NN-DL/Logistic-Regression-NN/Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb)
- **Description:** Building a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats.
