# iLearnDL Deep Learning Repository

This repository is part of my deep learning learning journey inspired by the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization. It focuses on deep learning fundamentals and practical implementations.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

### 1. NN-DL

#### 1.1 Python-Numpy-Basics

- **Project:** [Python_Basics_With_Numpy.ipynb](iLearnDL/NN-DL/Python-Numpy-Basics/Python_Basics_With_Numpy.ipynb)
- **Description:** A brief introduction to Python and Numpy.

#### 1.2 Logistic-Regression-NN

- **Project:** [Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb](iLearnDL/NN-DL/Logistic-Regression-NN/Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb)
- **Description:** Building a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats.

#### 1.3 Planar-Data-Classification

- **Project:** [Planar_data_classification_with_onehidden_layer.ipynb](iLearnDL/NN-DL/Planar-Data-Classification/Planar_data_classification_with_onehidden_layer.ipynb)
- **Description:** Implementation of a simple neural network with a hidden layer for planar data classification.

#### 1.4 Building-Deep-NN

- **Project:** [Building_your_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb](iLearnDL/NN-DL/Building-Deep-NN/Building_your_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step.ipynb)
- **Description:** Implementation of all the functions required to build a deep neural network step by step.

## Coursera Deep Learning Specialization

This repository is part of my deep learning journey inspired by the [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

This repository is yet to be complete but will be updated with more projects and learning materials.
